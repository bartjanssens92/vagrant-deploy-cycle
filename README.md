This is a vagrant environment to demonstrate the new pipeline setup. It consists of a pulp server, a jenkins server and a web server. The idea is that a git repo gets pulled in and packaged by jenkins. 
Then it gets put in a pulp repo and last it gets deployed to the web server. 

If this project ever makes it to Github, feel free to play, send pull requests and fork this project.
